    # > Note: The prereleased type will not trigger for pre-releases published from draft releases, but the published type will trigger. If you want a workflow to run when stable and pre-releases publish, subscribe to published instead of released and prereleased.
    # So, if you Draft a prerelease apparently publishing is then impossible. 
    # I believe the workaround is to re-create the pre-release against the same tag
